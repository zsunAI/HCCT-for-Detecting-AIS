The Super-Resolution Medical Network (SRMNet) was used to enhance the z-axis resolution of CT images from 5 mm to 1 mm, generating 1-mm NCCT. 
Global histogram equalization was applied as an efficient alternative to the traditional stroke window, and a three-level Daubechies wavelet transform was utilized. 
By nullifying the coefficient amplitudes in high-frequency sub-bands and preserving only the low-frequency components, a high-contrast image, referred to as the HCCT image, was produced through inverse transformation of these modified wavelet coefficients.
